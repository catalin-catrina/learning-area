/* 
Link can exist in different states, which can be targeted with the following pseudo-classes: a applies for both a:link and a:visited
:link
:visited
:hover
:focus
:active
*/

/* 
This order is important because link styles build on one another. For example, the styles in the first rule will apply to all the subsequent ones. When a link is activated, it's usually also hovered over. If you put these in the wrong order, and you're changing the same properties in each ruleset, things won't work as you expect. To remember the order, you could try using a mnemonic like LoVe Fears HAte.

/* 
here we're inserting a custom background image on external links in a similar manner to how we handled custom bullets on list items in the last article. This time, however, we're using the background shorthand instead of the individual properties. We set the path to the image we want to insert, specify no-repeat so we only get one copy inserted, and then specify the position as 100% of the way to the right of the text content, and 0 pixels from the top.

We also use background-size to specify the size we want the background image to be shown at. It's useful to have a larger icon and then resize it like this as needed for responsive web design purposes. This does, however, only work with IE 9 and later. So if you need to support older browsers, you'll just have to resize the image and insert it as is.

Finally, we set some padding-right on the links to make space for the background image to appear in, so we aren't overlapping it with the text.

/* In addition, links are quite commonly styled to look and behave like buttons in certain circumstances. A website navigation menu is usually marked up as a list containing links, and this can be easily styled to look like a set of control buttons or tabs that provide the user with access to other parts of the site. Let's explore how. */
