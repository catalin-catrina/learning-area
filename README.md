# My Learning Area

This is where my (almost) daily study sessions go.

Notes: 
- Commit messages don't follow any naming convention or best practice.
- My old portfolio was retired. The new portfolio repo is currently hidden and under complete revamp. You can check the current progress on one of the projects that will go there, in the <practice-projects/angular-apps/angular-instagram-clone> path.
